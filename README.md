#  Superstore Sales Dashboard (Power BI)

##  Overview

This Power BI dashboard is built using the **Superstore Sales dataset**. It provides a clear summary of key business metrics such as:

- Total Sales
- Profit
- Quantity Sold
- Average Delivery Days

It helps uncover insights across product categories, regions, customer behavior, and time.


##  Key Visuals

**Sales by Category & Sub-Category**  
  Identify top-performing product types.

  **Sales by Ship Mode & Payment Mode**  
  Understand customer delivery and payment preferences.

  **Sales and Profit by Year**

  **Daily Sales Trends**  
  Visualize sales over time using a line chart.

  **Sales by Region**  
  Evaluate performance across Central, East, South, and West regions.


##  Map Visual Note 

 If the **Map visual is not displaying** in Power BI, check the following:

1. Ensure you are **connected to the internet** (maps require Bing Maps).
2. In **Data view**, select your location column (e.g., `Region`), go to:
   - `Column Tools > Data Category`, and set it to **State**, **City**, or **Country**.
3. If using a **company network**, security settings might block the map. Try a personal network or consult IT support.
